          Parkinson's is a neurodegenerative disorder. While its exact cause is
          unknown, both genetic and environmental factors play a role. There is
          no cure, but treatment aims to manage symptoms and improve quality of
          life.

          Lung cancer often develops due to smoking, exposure to secondhand
          smoke, or environmental factors like asbestos. Quitting smoking and
          avoiding exposure to harmful substances can reduce the risk.
